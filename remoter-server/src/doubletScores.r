## STEP 5. Doublet score filter 
#################################################
# This is a simplest filter that looks at a threshold value for the doublet scores. 
# To separate cells with low droplet score from the ones that have a high droplet score content what makes us think that the are mistakenly considered as a single cell but they are actully two or more.  
# This can be a useful first guess. The settings for such a filter can also contain a simple "probabilityThreshold" setting. 


# The most uses values in doublet scores reporting in the scrublet paper [1] are around 0.25. There are not too much literature about how to compute
# a threshold. For now, we will offer two methods:
# --> Absolute threshold: In order to be not too extrictive the threshold is set to 0.25
generate_default_values_doubletScores <- function(scdata, config) {

    # HARDCODE

#'          - auto: true/false. 'True' indicates that the filter setting need to be changed depending on some sensible value (it requires
#'          to call generate_default_values_doubletScores)
